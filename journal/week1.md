<p><i>Developers refer to containers as “lightweight” because they share the host machine's OS kernel and aren't subject to extra overhead. Their lightweight feature drives higher server efficiencies and reduces server and licensing costs. It also speeds up start-time since there is no OS to boot.</i><p>
